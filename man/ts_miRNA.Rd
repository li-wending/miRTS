\title{Tissue-enriched miRNA marker map used for MCP-counter-style scoring}
\format{
A data frame with 2 columns:
\describe{
\item{miRNA}{Character. miRNA identifier matching rownames of the input
expression matrix (e.g., \code{"hsa-miR-122-5p"}).}
\item{enriched_organ}{Character. Tissue/organ label for which the miRNA is
enriched (e.g., \code{"liver"}, \code{"heart"}, etc.).}
}
}
\source{
Curated tissue-specific miRNA list distributed with the package
(file: \verb{Signature_matrix/tissue-specific miRNAs.csv}).
}
\usage{
ts_miRNA
}
\description{
A two-column mapping of tissue-enriched miRNAs to their enriched tissue/organ
labels. This object is used to construct \code{ts_df} (the marker table) when
running \code{miRTS_score(method = "MCP-counter")}, and is also compatible with
\code{compute_mcp_mirna_scores()}.
}
\details{
This mapping relationship is consistent with the tissue-specific miRNAs in the \code{miRTS_signature_v1}

When \code{method = "MCP-counter"} is selected in \code{miRTS_score()}, a marker list is
constructed by grouping miRNAs by \code{enriched_organ}. Tissue scores are then
computed by aggregating expression across marker miRNAs within each tissue
(median by default; see \code{compute_mcp_mirna_scores()}).
}

# Example: build marker list (one vector of miRNAs per tissue)
marker_list <- split(ts_miRNA$miRNA, ts_miRNA$enriched_organ)
length(marker_list)
