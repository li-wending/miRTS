\title{Example extracellular miRNA counts}
\format{
A numeric matrix (or data frame) with m miRNAs (rows) and n samples
(columns).
\itemize{
\item Row names: miRNA IDs (e.g., "hsa-miR-122-5p", "hsa-let-7a-5p").
\item Column names: sample IDs (e.g., "sample_01", "sample_02", ...).
}

The values represent normalized expression / intensity units derived from
microarray data (see manuscript), and are suitable as input to
\code{miRTS_score()}. They are not raw sequencing counts.

\description{
A small example dataset of circulating extracellular miRNA expression
measured in human plasma/serum samples. This object is intended for
demonstrating the use of the \code{miRTS} package.
}
\details{
This dataset is provided to illustrate a typical input to \code{miRTS_score()}.
It can be used together with the \code{miRTS_signature_v1} object to compute
tissue-specific miR-TS scores:

\preformatted{
  data(example_counts)
  data(miRTS_signature_v1)

  scores <- miRTS_score(
    counts           = example_counts,
    signature_matrix = miRTS_signature_v1
  )
}

The original data were derived from PMID: 27227815,
which quantified miRNAs using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
Note that miR-TS was originally designed for sequencing data,
but here microArray data was intentionally chosen to demonstrate that
miR-TS can be easily extended to miRNA data generated from other platforms.

The authors provided "counts" data in log2-transformed, normalized format:
"Raw microarray data (CEL files) were imported into Partek Genomics Suite (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO), and probe set summaries were computed using Robust Multi-Array algorithm. To adjust for differences in labeling intensities and hybridization, a global normalization was made by aligning signal intensities of data arrays across the medians."
The code to re-generate the example_counts from published data:
\preformatted{
GSE74872 <- read.csv("./Example_data/GSE74872.csv", header = TRUE)
GSE74872.name <- read.table("./Example_data/GPL19117-74051.txt", sep = "\t")
library(dplyr)
GSE74872.name <- GSE74872.name %>% select(V1, V4)
GSE74872 <- GSE74872 %>%
  inner_join(., GSE74872.name, by="V1")
GSE74872 <- GSE74872 %>%
 rename(miRNA=V4) %>%
 filter(grepl("hsa", miRNA)) %>%
 select(-V1)
rownames(GSE74872) <- GSE74872$miRNA
GSE74872$miRNA <- NULL
GSE74872 <- 2^GSE74872 # Convert back to the count scale
GSE74872[is.na(GSE74872)] <- 0
dim(GSE74872)
example_counts <- GSE74872
}

The samples and values have been anonymized and reduced for the purpose of
package examples and do not correspond to identifiable individuals.
